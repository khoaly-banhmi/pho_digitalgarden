I have always been looking for a place to host my thoughts. Hosting them within my brain by memory is definitely not sustainable. I wish I was Sherlock Holmes who has perfect photographic memories. Every time I needed something, I could just freeze time and go to my "[mind place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co5rbkyRXOo)", flicked through the pages floating mid-air and talked to experts in split seconds. Though I do not have the ability to memorize everything perfectly and access it from anywhere, I can use Obsidian to do just that. 

The definition of Digital Gardening, and how I use it to facilitate my learning
Choosing the right tool, from notebooks, to the native Apple App, to Notion, to Google Docs, Microsoft Office.

Being able to map the ideas out into a web, and access them easily, have them link with each other. Similar to a brain, when jotting down thoughts, with more connection, more linked are made, neurons bridges are forged and become stronger, making you remember to longer and in more details.

A lot of the things above can be solved using Notion, but Notion does not fit my scope of use, and I really dislike its design as having extra design elements that does not serve any functional purposes. 

The problem of not easily access notes, and migrating them if needed. My notes and thought are stuck with the app --> File-over-app

# What is Digital Gardening?

I stumbled across Obsidian as a tool to organize notes and organize them as a "second brain." I was amazed, and if true, Obsidian can be a very useful tool for my learning in college because of the I have been always finding a way to store my notes.

From high school, most of my notes are on paper. I used a large amount of notebooks and papers and note frantically. Most of my notes are made for math, mostly Calculus. I made very detailed notes and beautiful drawings, but I rarely use them for reference, so they soon fade away and I no longer remember them. 

With Obsidian, I am able to create links from within notes, so one topic that mentioned another topic can be linked together, like neurons in the brain. Digital Gardening is keeping the system of notes "alive" by constantly revising them, updating them with new ideas, linking and widening with more connections. In a woods, trees grows taller and bigger with more branches and there root system connects for nutrition sharing. Notes in a digital garden undergoes a similar timeline, ideas are initiated and grow over time.

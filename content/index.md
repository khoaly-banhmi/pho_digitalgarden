**Howdy, internet wanders!**

Somehow you have stumbled upon my digital garden, where I host and organize my ideas for future reference and growth, like a personal wiki. The notes are all in markdown so they can be migrated, stored easily and sustainably. 

This site is made using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and formatted using [Obsidian MD](https://obsidian.md/). These are all open source software and maintained by the community. Create your own digital garden using the links above.

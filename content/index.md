**Howdy, internet wanders!**

Somehow you have stumbled upon my digital garden, where I host and organize my ideas for future reference and growth, like a personal wiki. The notes are all in markdown so they can be migrated, stored easily and sustainably. 

I am currently a freshman in [aerospace engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/index.html) at Texas A&M, College Station. Apart from studying full time, I am teaching myself web development and wandering the fields of sustainable aviation. I surround myself with the guiding principles of Respect, Excellence, Leadership, Loyalty, Selfless Service. My digital garden will be built around the following topics:
1. Professional career: things I learn along the way to excel in aerospace engineering and sustainable development
2. Learning to learn: how to effectively filter, organize, and actively recall information
3. Healthy mind and physical body: nutrition, exercising routine
4. Education: teaching resilience, emotional intelligence, and passing on the love of exploring.

You can get in touch via email: lynhatkhoa@tamu.edu

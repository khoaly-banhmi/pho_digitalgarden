Companies make policies guaranteeing their users' data privacy, but policies can be changed, and promises are broken all the time. Information is leaked, used for advertising without the users' acknowledgement â€” information is sold, anyone who has more information can make more out of it. In the age of hyper-interconnectedness, data are gold. 

Apple, *a company famous for initiatives in privacy*, [is facing a lawsuit](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/apple-siri-lawsuit-settlement-iphone-eavesdropping-claim/) for listening their users in 2025. Facebook faced many lawsuits for data breaching. Data is not only taken from users, they are also trapped inside tools people use. Microsoft Words documents work best with Windows machines, may break if you use other softwares, and at best usable but buggy. Notion provides unlimited working space but your information are stored on there clouds. Adobe *encourages* user to store files on Adobe Cloud. There are iClouds, Google Drive, Onedrive. Brands are slapped onto your data, and there are very limited choices to host data on your own. 

You are required to trust the brands how they manage your data, which all happens behind closed door. You can *request* for your information, and then *ask* them to delete your data. Is it your data overall? Users are stuck in having limited options, and lawsuits back-and-forth on court wars, a tug of war for their **own** data.

## What is a self-guaranteeing promise?

A self-guaranteeing promises consists of two things: 
1. Can be proven easily by the user,
2. Cannot be revoked.

A very good example of a self-guaranteeing promise is stainless-steel. Before I go further into explaining this, I want to clarify that stainless-steel is not rust proofed, but it is a lot more unlikely to rust as compared to normal steel. The steel *stainlessness* can be easily proven by the user, people buy stainless-steel pan can see that the pan do not rust after humidity exposure, slight chemical usage. The *stainlessness* also cannot be revoked, no companies can update their policies in a blink of an eye and your pan suddenly rusts.

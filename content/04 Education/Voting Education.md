The modern democratic society emphasizes on the right to vote. Voting is detrimental to maintaining a progressive, civil society. However, knowing how to select a good leader is the other side of the coin, but usually tucked hidden.

Socrate had a wonderful metaphor for a good and a bad leader in a voting, democratic society â€” a candy maker and a doctor. The doctor said by voting for him, though people may experience pain and temporary discomfort, diseases can be treated and eradicated. The doctor seams scary with scalpels, white gowns, and science a handful of people know. The candy maker, on the other hand, looked colorful, with fun, flavorful candies that tasted sweet and bring instant joy. Who will you vote for?

Voting, in order to serve democracy, needs to be taught systematically, not randomly given intuition. 
Socratesâ€™s point is that voting in an election is a skill, not a random intuition. And like any skill, it needs to be taught systematically to people.

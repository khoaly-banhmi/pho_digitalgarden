There are two methods to calculate/estimate the volume of an object:
1. General Slicing Method: given the base, and assumption that every perpendicular slice are simple shapes and similar to each other.
2. The Disk Method: given the outline of the shape that revolves around an axis.

Be aware that an axis can be any axis, such as the x-axis, the $x = -5$ line may also be used as a axis, but a curve is not an axis!

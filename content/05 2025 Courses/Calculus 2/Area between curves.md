To find the area between curves, follow these steps:
1. Rough sketch: There can be other tasks needed to complete this step, review the following:
	1. Absolute value:$$
\begin{align*}
|A| = 
\left\{
    \begin {aligned}
         & A \quad & A \geq 0 \\
         & -A \quad & A < 0                  
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\end{align*}
$$
	2. Finding parabola's vertex: for $$
y = f(x) = ax^2+bx+c
$$
$$
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
$$
2. Find the intervals: where do the curves intersect?
3. Find the area using integrations 

If finding the area by integrating with x (or in my word "moving along the x-axis) requires more intervals or is too difficult to do, you may use integrating with y.

Jean Guitton nói: "*Nhà văn cần phải biết nín lặng, đừng nói hết ý nghĩ của kình và phải để cho độc giả có chỗ tỏ ra sự hiểu biết của họ*". 

Rules to note effectively:
1. **Concise**: a meaning is conveyed once. If necessary, it can be repeated for emphasis. Use less word if that's enough.
2. **Comprehensive**: avoid too much jargons. 
3. **Avoid redundancy**: only use negative structure when necessary.
4. **Idea central**: logic is key, use ethos for persuasion when needed. 
5. **Consistency for linking**: use keywords that allows linking between notes.

For math notes using Latex, simply note down math with a notebook and convert to Latex later when reviewing.

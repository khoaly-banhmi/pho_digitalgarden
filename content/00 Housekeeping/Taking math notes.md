Obsidian supports Latex math formatting. Another plugin Latex suit is also installed to simplify and streamline math typing. Refer to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite?tab=readme-ov-file) to see the cheatsheet and manual. 

To start using, type 'dm' to type. Use the space below as a playground to get familiar with Latex Suite.

$$
y = \frac{a+b}{c+d}
$$

$$
\int_a^b(2x^3+5x+12)dx = [\frac{1}{2}x^4
+5]_{a}^b$$

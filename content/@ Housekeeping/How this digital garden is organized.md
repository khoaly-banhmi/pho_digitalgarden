Notes created fall into the following categories:

1. ☁️ Clouds: These are ideas from other authors and can be anything from small notes, book excerpts, blog posts, etc. The clouds also contain my thoughts about those fragments.
2. 🌱 Seeds: Created when clouds are heavy enough and rain down to my garden. These are my own thoughts and notes inspired by those ideas.
3. 🪴 Saplings: As seeds develop, they become saplings. These are more structured notes, more research are done to maintain them.
4. 🌳 Evergreens: Very strong growing segments of the garden. Evergreens may give life to other seeds, host and link smaller seeds and saplings.
5. 🌻 Blossomed: These are evergreens that have sustained the test of time and started to yield products of there very own. They are now gain the status similar to clouds.
6. 🍎 Fruits: Products of the blossomed. This is usually a navigation to different garden of their own.
7. 🧭 Navigation: Serve within this garden. These can be compilations, structured collection of any kinds.
8. 🪵 Stumps: Outdated ideas and no longer developed, but kept for record.

I do not develop these concepts myself, they are a combination of other people's concept for digital garden. Also check out [Utsob's garden](https://hermitage.utsob.me/) and [Tim Rodenbröker's blog](https://timrodenbroeker.de/digital-garden/).

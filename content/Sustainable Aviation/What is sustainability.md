The [UN](https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/sustainability#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cmeeting%20the%20needs%20of%20the%20present%20without%20compromising%20the%20ability%20of%20future%20generations%20to%20meet%20their%20own%20needs.%E2%80%9D) defined sustainability as **"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."** This definition focuses on the very general goal of sustainability, which is to maintain and sustain the world resources. To better understand how this is done, we need to refer to UCLA Sustainability.

According to [UCLA](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/what-is-sustainability/),sustainability comprises of three elements:
1. **Environment:** Resources are used and replenished at equilibrium.
2. **Economy:** Efforts to maintain equilibrium for the future does not negatively affect the current economy, such as impoverish any communities.
3. **Equity:** Human's right and equal development are not compromised.

These three elements supports each other like a three-legged stool, in any cases that one of the elements are compromised, the stool toppled and sustainability is not ensured. In the next parts, I will discuss each element of sustainability, the past, the status quo, future development, and how sustainable aviation contribute to the [UN's sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

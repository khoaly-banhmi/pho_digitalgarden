## My story with sustainable aviation
My first ever flying experience was with the old ATR-72 operated by Vietnam Airlines to Con Dao. I was 5 year old, flying with my mom and her company on a company trip. The flight was quite short, about 30 minutes from Ho Chi Minh City, but it was the most griping 30 minutes ever for a 5-year-old.

I just could not wrap my head around how a bunch of people, stuck on a steel tube shot through the atmosphere could be possible. I was mesmerized by the low buzzing of the two propellers, yet constantly feeling funny because honestly I was a very bumpy flight. The planed landed, slammed on to the tarmac because of bad weather, I hit my head on the seat next to me. Maybe some chemical changes were initiated, but I was hooked in with aviation since then.
